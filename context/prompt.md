You are a senior software engineer and front-end architect specializing in React Native and TypeScript. Your job is to reverse-engineer the **Portfolio (Wallet tab)** feature inside the Ledger Live Mobile monorepo (`apps/ledger-live-mobile`) and create a high-fidelity static UI replica screen of the wallet view.  Refactor every single component involved in rendering the Wallet tab screen in Ledger Live Mobile so that each one runs solely on static (mock) data while retaining the original component structure, props, and styling.


## 1. Objective

You are a senior React Native engineer. Your mission is to create a high-fidelity, **static UI replica** of the `Portfolio` screen from the Ledger Live Mobile application.

The definitive blueprint for this task is the screen rendered by **`apps/ledger-live-mobile/src/screens/Portfolio/index.tsx`**. The goal is to achieve 100% visual fidelity while simplifying the internal structure and using exclusively static, hardcoded data.

## 2. Core Principles

*   **Simulate Data, Never Logic:** All data (portfolio balance, account lists, graph points) must be hardcoded. No business logic, calculations, or data fetching from the original app should be replicated.
*   **Static Data via Mock Hooks:** Replace all Redux selectors and `live-common` hooks with simple, custom mock hooks (e.g., `usePortfolio`, `useAccounts`) that return static `Display*` objects.
*   **Embrace Container/Presentational Pattern:** Replicate the original app's architecture.
    *   **Presentational Components** (e.g., `GraphCard`, `AssetRow`) handle the UI and receive data only through props.
    *   **Container Components** (e.g., `PortfolioGraphCard`) are simplified to only call a mock hook and pass data to their children.

## 3. Key Component Hierarchy

The screen is assembled from the following key components. The task is to replicate the *presenters* and create simplified *containers*.

*   **Screen Entry:** `PortfolioScreen` (`.../screens/Portfolio/index.tsx`)
    *   **Role:** The top-level component that calls mock hooks and assembles the main sections.
*   **Graph Section:**
    *   **Container:** `PortfolioGraphCard` (`.../screens/Portfolio/PortfolioGraphCard.tsx`)
    *   **Presenter:** `GraphCard` (`.../components/GraphCard.tsx`)
*   **Assets List Section:**
    *   **Container:** `PortfolioAssets` (`.../screens/Portfolio/PortfolioAssets.tsx`)
    *   **List Renderer:** `Assets` (`.../screens/Portfolio/Assets.tsx`)
    *   **Row Presenter:** `AssetRow` (`.../screens/WalletCentricAsset/AssetRow.tsx`)

## 4. Data & Component Flow

The data flow in the replica is simple: mock hooks provide static data to container components, which then pass it down to presentational components.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Mock Data Layer"
        A[usePortfolio hook<br/>(returns static portfolio data)]
        B[useAccounts hook<br/>(returns static account list)]
    end

    subgraph "Screen & Components"
        C(PortfolioScreen)
        A --> C
        B --> C

        C --> D[PortfolioGraphCard<br/>props: { portfolio }]
        C --> E[PortfolioAssets<br/>props: { accounts }]

        D --> F[GraphCard]
        E --> G[Assets]

        G --> H[FlatList<br/>data={props.accounts}]
        H -- "renderItem" --> I[AssetRow<br/>props: { account }]
    end
```

## 5. Styling & Theming Mandates

*   **UI Library:** Use `@ledgerhq/native-ui` for all layout primitives (`Flex`, `Box`) and core components. Prefer props-based styling (e.g., `px={6}`, `mt={7}`).
*   **Theme:** The application **must** use a replicated `darkTheme` from `.../src/colors.tsx`, provided via `styled-components`' `ThemeProvider`.
*   **Text:** All text **must** be rendered using a replicated `LText` component from `.../src/components/LText/`. Do not use the default `<Text>` component.
