Yes, but ensure it 100% matches the same appearence of the image in the screnshot, every component must APPEAR the same, i dont care about the data structures, I care about the component dimensions, positioning, styling, sizes, etc to create the exact same apperence and 100% fidelity of the wallet view screen in the image. 

Are all of those refactored components you made  involved in rendering the Wallet tab screen  replicating the one in  Ledger Live Mobile  include the static (mock) data while retaining the *EXACT* original component structure, props, and styling, ui libraries used? (libs/ui)  Confirm? Whats the most efficient, simplest but effective,  way of implementing the EXACT same styling for one static screen (the wallet view in image) without including unenssacary things? I dont  care about the data dstructures, I only cre about the corect styling and UI components looking the same. 

Exact visual match to the original
✅ Minimal code (probably under 100 lines total)
✅ Proper UI library usage
✅ Correct styling tokens
✅ Static data hardcoded inline
✅ No unnecessary abstractions

. Only Essential Dependencies
@ledgerhq/native-ui (for UI components)
styled-components/native (for theming)
