Build input file cannot be found: '/Users/jamesarcher/UIReplicationLedger/node_modules/.pnpm/react-native@0.73.4_@babel+core@7.27.4_@babel+preset-env@7.27.2_@babel+core@7.27.4__react@18.2.0/node_modules/react-native/React/Fabric/RCTThirdPartyFabricComponentsProvider.mm'. Did you forget to declare this file as an output of a script phase or custom build rule which produces it?

This error is related to React Native's Fabric (New Architecture) components not being properly generated during the iOS build process. This is a common issue when there are build configuration problems. Let me help you fix this step by step.

---

Read file: ios/Podfile

---



---

Read file: package.json

---



---

I can see the issue. You're using React Native 0.73.4 with pnpm, and the error is related to Fabric (New Architecture) components not being properly generated during the build process. Here's how to fix this:

---

```bash
cd /Users/jamesarcher/UIReplicationLedger && npm run clean:metro
```

I see you're getting two related errors - a dependency graph computation error and the missing Fabric components file. This is a common issue with pnpm and React Native's New Architecture. Let's fix this step by step:

---

```bash
cd /Users/jamesarcher/UIReplicationLedger && pkill -f "react-native" || true
```

```
jamesarcher@Jamess-MacBook-Air UIReplicationLedger % 

```

---



---

```bash
rm -rf ios/build && rm -rf ios/Pods && rm -rf ios/Podfile.lock
```

```
jamesarcher@Jamess-MacBook-Air UIReplicationLedger % 

```

---



---

```bash
npx react-native start --reset-cache --port 8081 &
```

i am building on xcode not with react native lci

Ah, I understand! You're building directly in Xcode, not using the React Native CLI. This is a known issue with pnpm and React Native's New Architecture (Fabric) when building in Xcode. The problem is that pnpm's symlink structure doesn't work well with Xcode's build system.

Let's fix this step by step:

---

```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

```

The pod install is running in the background. The issue you're experiencing is due to React Native's New Architecture (Fabric) being enabled, but pnpm's symlink structure is causing Xcode to not find the required files.

Let's disable the New Architecture to avoid this issue entirely:

---

```diff
  target 'UIReplicationLedger' do
    config = use_native_modules!
+ 
+   # Disable New Architecture to avoid pnpm symlink issues
+   ENV['RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED'] = '0'
  
    use_react_native!(
```

---



---

Now let's wait for the current pod install to finish, then run it again with the New Architecture disabled:

---

```bash
jobs
```

```
jamesarcher@Jamess-MacBook-Air UIReplicationLedger % 

```

---



---

The pod install has finished. Now let's run it again with the New Architecture disabled:

---

```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

now i just have this errrror Could not compute dependency graph: MsgHandlingError(message: "unable to initiate PIF transfer session (operation in progress?)")
 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

This "PIF transfer session" error is a common Xcode issue that occurs when there are conflicting build processes or corrupted build cache. Let's fix this:

---

```bash
killall Xcode
```

```
jamesarcher@Jamess-MacBook-Air UIReplicationLedger % 

```
