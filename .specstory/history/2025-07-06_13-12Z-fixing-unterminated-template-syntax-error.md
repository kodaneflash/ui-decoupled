<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has a syntax error in their Delta.tsx file. Looking at the error and the file content, I can see the problem:

1. The file is incomplete - it ends with an unterminated template literal on line 109: `{range && \``
2. There are missing closing tags for JSX elements
3. The StyleSheet definition (`styles`) is missing

The file appears to be truncated or corrupted during their revert. I need to fix this by completing the file properly.

Looking at the file, I can see:
- Line 109 has an unterminated template literal: `{range && \``
- There are missing closing tags for View and Text elements
- There's no StyleSheet definition for the styles being used

I need to fix this by:
1. Completing the template literal or removing it if it's not needed
2. Adding the missing closing tags
3. Adding the StyleSheet definition

Let me examine what should be there. Looking at the structure, it seems like the file got cut off. I need to:

1. Complete the JSX structure
2. Add the missing StyleSheet
3. Close all the open tags properly

Let me fix this step by step.</details></think>
