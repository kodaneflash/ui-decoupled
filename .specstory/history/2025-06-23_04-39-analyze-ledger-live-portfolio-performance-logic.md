# Analyze Ledger Live portfolio performance logic (2025-06-23 00:39:43)

_**User**_

You are a senior software engineer with expertise in React Native, TypeScript, and advanced financial data rendering in UI components.

Task:
Analyze how the real Ledger Live mobile app calculates and renders portfolio percentage gain/loss over timeframes such as '1Y' or 'All'. This includes reviewing the logic in the following components:
	•	@Delta.tsx
	•	@AssetRowLayout.tsx
	•	@CounterValue.tsx
	•	@PortfolioAssets.tsx
	•	@GraphCard.tsx

Objectives:
	1.	Determine how Ledger calculates overall portfolio performance over a selected timeframe.
	2.	Confirm whether the app tracks individual crypto daily % changes, or if it instead computes portfolio value snapshots (e.g., month-by-month) and derives % change based on historical portfolio valuations.
	3.	Extract and explain the key logic and data flow used to calculate those deltas.
	4.	Document your findings and breakdown in a new Markdown file: deltadynamic.md.  	Ensure the output is structured clearly so it can serve as a direct reference for implementing the same logic in our own portfolio tracking components.

Expected Output:
	•	A complete deltadynamic.md file
	•	Includes:
	•	Explanation of Ledger’s delta calculation method
	•	Description of how and where historical data is used
	•	Key component roles in rendering the % gain
	•	Insights on how the UI updates with timeframe selection
