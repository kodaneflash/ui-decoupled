<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, the `DiscreetModeButton.tsx` file exists in the components directory. Let me check its content to see if there are any issues with the export or implementation.</details></think>

---

Read file: src/components/DiscreetModeButton.tsx

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The `DiscreetModeButton` component looks fine and has a proper default export. The issue might be with the import statement itself or how it's being used. Let me check the current Portfolio index.tsx file again to see the exact import statement and make sure it's correct.

Looking at the import in the Portfolio screen:
```typescript
import DiscreetModeButton from '../../components/DiscreetModeButton';
```

This looks correct based on the file structure. Let me check if there are any TypeScript compilation issues by running a search for any potential issues.

Let me also check the exact error by looking at the build logs or trying to understand what "ModuleResolver.resolveDependency" error means. This is typically a Metro bundler issue.

First, let me check if there are any circular dependencies or other import issues by examining related files that might be causing the problem.</details></think>

---

The `DiscreetModeButton` component exists and looks correctly implemented. The import path appears correct too. The "ModuleResolver.resolveDependency" error is typically a Metro bundler issue. Let me check for potential causes and fix them:

---

```bash
cd /Users/jamesarcher/UIReplicationLedger && npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

Remove the importand usage  completely for now 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to remove the DiscreetModeButton import and usage completely from the Portfolio screen. I need to:

1. Remove the import line
2. Remove the usage of DiscreetModeButton in the component

Looking at the file, I can see:
- Line 7: `import DiscreetModeButton from '../../components/DiscreetModeButton';`
- Around line 73-75: The usage in the JSX where DiscreetModeButton is being used

Let me remove both the import and the usage.</details></think>

---

I'll remove the `DiscreetModeButton` import and its usage from the Portfolio screen.

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to remove the usage of DiscreetModeButton in the JSX. The linter error indicates it's still being used around line 81. Let me find and remove that usage.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully removed both the import and the usage of DiscreetModeButton from the Portfolio screen. The changes I made:

1. Removed the import line: `import DiscreetModeButton from '../../components/DiscreetModeButton';`
2. Removed the JSX usage: `<DiscreetModeButton size={20} />` and its container `<Box ml={3}>`
3. Updated the comment from "Left Section: Title + Discreet Mode Button" to just "Left Section: Title"

This should resolve the ModuleResolver.resolveDependency error that was preventing the Xcode build from succeeding.</details></think>

Perfect! I've successfully removed the `DiscreetModeButton` import and its usage from the Portfolio screen. The changes made:

1. **Removed the import line**: `import DiscreetModeButton from '../../components/DiscreetModeButton';`
2. **Removed the component usage**: The `<DiscreetModeButton size={20} />` component and its wrapper `<Box ml={3}>` 
3. **Updated the comment**: Changed from "Left Section: Title + Discreet Mode Button" to just "Left Section: Title"

This should resolve the ModuleResolver.resolveDependency error that was causing your Xcode build to fail. You can now try building the project again.
