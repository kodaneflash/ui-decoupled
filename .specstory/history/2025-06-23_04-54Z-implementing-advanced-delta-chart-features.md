# Implementing advanced delta chart features (2025-06-23 04:54Z)

_**User**_

You are a senior software engineer with expertise in React Native, TypeScript, and interactive chart-based financ@deltadynamic.md deltadynamic.md to have context for this implementation, then begin analyzing the steps. I will give you the restof the steps after these are done. 

Your goal is to replace the simple Delta chart and chart currently in use with the advanced @Delta.tsx implementation from Ledger Live, adapted to work with static portfolio data and fully support timeframe-based delta calculations.

You will complete each task in order. Only proceed to the next task after I confirm. Task 1: Analyze Chart Usage in @Delta.tsx
	â€¢	Identify the chart or visual logic used by Ledger Liveâ€™s @Delta.tsx to render:
	â€¢	Arrows for gain/loss direction
	â€¢	Green/red conditional color
	â€¢	Percentage and dollar deltas
	â€¢	Compare with your current Delta/chart setup.
	â€¢	Determine what needs to be changed to match @Delta.tsx. Task 2: Modify portfolioData.ts to Support Timeframes
	â€¢	Update the static asset data structure in portfolioData.ts to support historical snapshots for each timeframe (1D, 1W, 1Y, ALL).
	â€¢	Each asset (e.g., BTC, SOL) should include:  (identify which props to use by analyzing official ledger-live-mobile components) 	These values represent fiat balance snapshots used to compute deltas.

ðŸ“Œ DO NOT proceed to the next task until I confirm.
Please complete Task 2 now and wait for my confirmation before continuing.
Let me know when youâ€™re ready for Task 3.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me analyze the Delta.tsx implementation and the current portfolio data structure to understand what needs to be changed.

First, let me examine the provided Delta.tsx file from the official Ledger Live to understand the chart/visual logic:

From the official Ledger Live Delta.tsx file, I can see:
1. It uses ArrowEvolutionUpMedium and ArrowEvolutionDownMedium icons for direction
2. It uses semantic color tokens: success.c70/success.c50 for positive, error.c50 for negative
3. It renders percentage and dollar deltas based on ValueChange interface
4. It has complex logic for handling different display modes (percent vs absolute)

Now comparing with the current implementation in UIReplicationLedger/src/components/Delta.tsx:
- It's similar but uses IconsLegacy.ArrowEvolutionUpMedium/Down
- Uses the same color scheme
- Has similar ValueChange interface

For Task 1, I need to analyze the chart/visual logic differences and identify what needs to be changed.

For Task 2, I need to modify portfolioData.ts to support historical snapshots for timeframes. Looking at the deltadynamic.md analysis, I can see that Ledger Live uses:
- Historical balance snapshots for different timeframes
- Different granularities (hourly for 1D/1W, daily for 1M, weekly for 1Y/ALL)
- Portfolio aggregation across assets
- Delta calculation from first significant balance

Let me start with Task 1.</details></think>

I'll help you analyze and implement the advanced Delta chart functionality. Let me start with Task 1 by examining the chart/visual logic used by Ledger Live's Delta.tsx.
