# Implementing efficient data solutions for portfolio balance (2025-07-06 10:36Z)

_**User**_

As a senior software engineer with expertise in TypeScript and React Native, your task is to design and implement an efficient solution that follows best practices to replace the static historical data sources for the 1-week (1W) and 1-month (1M) timeframes in the portfolio balance system. This solution should avoid hitting API limits by implementing caching mechanisms or using real historical market data instead of static historical data, which is currently being used and is considered inaccurate. Use the same amou

To begin, please review the portfolio data system analysis provided in @portfoliodatasystem.md for context. When modifying the 1W and 1M timeframes, ensure that any corresponding or related components in the data flow are updated for consistency with the new solution. The goal is to enhance realism by utilizing real historical market data while avoiding API errors, loading screens, and excessive API calls when the user interacts with different timeframes.

Your solution should aim to improve the performance of the system, ensuring that the graphs load quickly and smoothly without causing delays or errors. It's important to identify the most efficient and safe way to circumvent API rate limits, allowing for a seamless user experience while maintaining data accuracy and reliability.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to design and implement an efficient solution to replace the static historical data sources for 1-week (1W) and 1-month (1M) timeframes in the portfolio balance system. Let me analyze the context from the provided markdown file.

From the analysis, I can see:

1. **Current State**: 
   - Only 1D timeframe uses live API data from CoinGecko
   - 1W, 1M, 1Y, ALL timeframes use static historical data
   - Main balance calculation uses live prices for current portfolio value
   - The system has Bitcoin (83.5206 BTC) and Solana (6,247.57 SOL) as assets

2. **Key Components**:
   - `GraphCard.tsx` - Main portfolio balance display
   - `PriceService.ts` - Currently handles live data for 1D timeframe
   - `PriceContext.tsx` - Provides price calculation functions
   - Historical data sources for different timeframes

3. **Requirements**:
   - Replace static data for 1W and 1M with real historical data
   - Avoid API limits through caching mechanisms
   - Maintain smooth performance without loading delays
   - Ensure data accuracy and reliability

Let me first explore the current codebase to understand how it's structured and then propose a solution.

I should start by examining the current PriceService.ts to understand how 1D data is handled, then look at the GraphCard.tsx to see how timeframes are managed, and finally examine the historical data sources to understand what needs to be replaced.</details></think>

I'll analyze the current portfolio data system and implement an efficient solution to replace the static historical data for 1W and 1M timeframes with real historical market data while implementing proper caching mechanisms.

Let me start by examining the current implementation:

---

Read file: src/services/PriceService.ts

---

Read file: src/components/GraphCard.tsx

---

Read file: src/constants/portfolioData.ts

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I understand the current implementation. Let me analyze what I've found:

**Current System:**
1. **PriceService.ts** - Only handles live 1D data from CoinGecko API
2. **GraphCard.tsx** - Shows dynamic balance calculation and uses timeframe selection
3. **portfolioData.ts** - Contains static historical data for all timeframes (1D, 1W, 1M, 1Y, ALL)

**Key Issues:**
1. Static data in `HISTORICAL_BALANCES` is unrealistic for 1W and 1M timeframes
2. Only 1D timeframe uses live API data
3. No caching mechanism for historical data
4. API rate limiting concerns when fetching historical data

**Solution Requirements:**
1. Replace static 1W and 1M data with real historical data
2. Implement caching to avoid API rate limits
3.</details></think>
