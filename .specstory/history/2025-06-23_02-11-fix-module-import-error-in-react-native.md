# Fix module import error in React Native (2025-06-22 22:11:54)

Fix this: Unable to resolve module ./TabBarShape from /Users/jamesarcher/UIReplicationLedger/src/components/BottomNavigation/CustomTabBar.tsx: 

None of these files exist:
  * src/components/BottomNavigation/TabBarShape(.ios.js|.native.js|.js|.ios.jsx|.native.jsx|.jsx|.ios.json|.native.json|.json|.ios.ts|.native.ts|.ts|.ios.tsx|.native.tsx|.tsx)
  * src/components/BottomNavigation/TabBarShape
   6 | import { useSafeAreaInsets } from "react-native-safe-area-context";
   7 |
>  8 | import TabBarShape from "./TabBarShape";
     |                          ^
   9 | import BackgroundGradient, { darkGradients, lightGradients } from "./BackgroundGradient";
  10 | import TransferFAB from "./TransferFAB";
  11 | import { 

Tabbarshape is just a simple svg shape that should be in @CustomTabBar.tsx like it is for @CustomTabBar.tsx

I can see the issue. The `TabBarShape` component should be defined inline within the `CustomTabBar.tsx` file, just like in the original Ledger Live Mobile implementation. Let me fix this by adding the `TabBarShape` component directly to your file and removing the import.

Perfect! I've fixed the issue by moving the `TabBarShape` component directly into the `CustomTabBar.tsx` file, exactly like it's implemented in the original Ledger Live Mobile code. 

The changes I made:

1. **Removed the problematic import**: `import TabBarShape from "./TabBarShape";`
2. **Added the necessary SVG imports**: `import Svg, { Path } from "react-native-svg";`
3. **Added the component inline**: The `TabBarShape` function component is now defined directly in the file with the exact SVG path definitions from the original Ledger Live Mobile implementation

The `TabBarShape` component creates the distinctive curved cutout in the center of the tab bar using three SVG path sections:
- Left section (0-80px): Straight rectangle
- Center section (80-295px): Curved cutout for the FAB button
- Right section (295-375px): Straight rectangle

This matches the original Ledger Live Mobile architecture where the `TabBarShape` is kept inline rather than as a separate component file. The error should now be resolved and your bottom navigation should render correctly with the curved tab bar shape.

Fix this by analyzing what the ledger-live-mobile components did to handle the background gradient. @BackgroundGradient.tsx  @CustomTabBar.tsx     : Cannot convert undefined value to object

Looking at the error and the original Ledger Live Mobile implementation, I can see the issue. The gradients should be defined directly within the `CustomTabBar.tsx` file, not imported from elsewhere. Let me fix this by following the exact pattern from the original Ledger Live Mobile code.
