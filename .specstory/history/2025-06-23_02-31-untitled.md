You are a senior software engineer with deep expertise in React Native, TypeScript, and responsive UI/UX design.

Task:
Analyze the ledger-live-mobile codebase to locate the component(s) responsible for rendering and styling the “Assets & Accounts” menu on the Portfolio screen.

Objectives:
	1.	Identify the exact height, margin, and positioning styles applied to the Assets & Accounts menu in the official ledger-live-mobile implementation.
	2.	Compare this to our current implementation and determine the precise value needed to slightly shift the menu lower, bringing it closer to the Assets section — with pixel-level precision.

Constraints:
	•	Use only the official styling code from ledger-live-mobile (e.g. StyleSheet, styled-components, layout containers).
	•	Do not rely on estimations or assumptions. Ensure visual alignment is pixel-perfect.
	•	Return only the modified code or style adjustments needed to achieve the corrected position.
