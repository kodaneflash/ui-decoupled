Looking at these errors, yes, they appear to be related. The TypeScript errors in your `BottomNavigation.tsx` file are indicating missing types and configurations, which could be causing the runtime error where React Navigation can't find the properties it expects.

Let me check what's currently in your types and fix these issues:

---

Read file: src/types/navigation.ts

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/components/BottomNavigation • **8** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `index.ts` |
| 📄 `BottomNavigation.tsx` |
| 📄 `CustomTabBar.tsx` |
| 📄 `TransferFAB.tsx` |
| 📄 `BackgroundGradient.tsx` |
| 📄 `TabIcons.tsx` |
| 📄 `TabIcon.tsx` |
| 📄 `README.md` |

</details>

---



---

Read file: src/components/BottomNavigation/CustomTabBar.tsx

---

Read file: src/constants/tabBarConstants.ts

---



---

Read file: src/navigation/MainNavigator.tsx

---



---

Now I understand the issue! You have two conflicting bottom navigation setups:

1. **MainNavigator.tsx** - Using React Navigation's `createBottomTabNavigator` (correct approach)
2. **BottomNavigation.tsx** - Trying to create a standalone component that conflicts with React Navigation

The runtime error occurs because React Navigation expects certain route configurations that aren't properly set up. Let me fix this by:

1. First, adding the missing types to fix TypeScript errors
2. Then removing the conflicting standalone BottomNavigation component

---

```diff
    color: string;
    focused?: boolean;
- } 
+ }
+ 
+ // Tab State Interface for React Navigation compatibility
+ export interface TabState {
+   activeIndex: number;
+   routes: Array<{
+     name: string;
+     key: string;
+   }>;
+ }
+ 
+ // Tab Configuration Interface
+ export interface TabConfig {
+   name: string;
+   component: React.ComponentType<any>;
+   iconComponent: React.ComponentType<TabIconProps>;
+ }
+ 
+ // Tab Configurations - matching MainNavigator structure
+ export const TAB_CONFIGS: TabConfig[] = [
+   {
+     name: "Portfolio",
+     component: () => null, // Placeholder
+     iconComponent: ({ color, focused }) => null, // Placeholder
+   },
+   {
+     name: "Earn", 
+     component: () => null,
+     iconComponent: ({ color, focused }) => null,
+   },
+   {
+     name: "Transfer",
+     component: () => null,
+     iconComponent: ({ color, focused }) => null,
+   },
+   {
+     name: "Discover",
+     component: () => null,
+     iconComponent: ({ color, focused }) => null,
+   },
+   {
+     name: "MyLedger",
+     component: () => null,
+     iconComponent: ({ color, focused }) => null,
+   },
+ ];
+ 
+ // Main Navigator Param List
+ export interface MainNavigatorParamList {
+   Portfolio: undefined;
+   Earn: undefined; 
+   Transfer: undefined;
+   Discover: undefined;
+   MyLedger: undefined;
+ } 
```

Read file: App.tsx

Now I need to fix the root issue. The problem is that you have a standalone `BottomNavigation.tsx` component that conflicts with React Navigation's built-in bottom tab navigation. Your `App.tsx` correctly uses `MainNavigator` which already handles the bottom navigation properly.

Let me remove the conflicting standalone component:

---

Removing the standalone BottomNavigation component that conflicts with React Navigation's built-in bottom tab navigation

---

Read file: src/components/BottomNavigation/index.ts

---



---

```diff
- // Main bottom navigation component
- export { default } from "./BottomNavigation";
- export { default as BottomNavigation } from "./BottomNavigation";
- 
- // Individual components
+ // Individual components for React Navigation integration
  export { default as CustomTabBar } from "./CustomTabBar";
  export { default as BackgroundGradient } from "./BackgroundGradient";
```

---



---

Now let me fix the remaining TypeScript issues. I need to make sure the `CustomTabBar` properly handles the `onTabPress` prop and add the missing `TabBarShape` component:

---



---

```diff
  // Individual components for React Navigation integration
- export { default as CustomTabBar } from "./CustomTabBar";
+ export { default as CustomTabBar, TabBarShape } from "./CustomTabBar";
  export { default as BackgroundGradient } from "./BackgroundGradient";
  export { default as TransferFAB } from "./TransferFAB";
```

cd /Users/jamesarcher/UIReplicationLedger && pnpm run typecheck

Looking at the error stack trace, the issue is happening in `BottomTabView` which is part of React Navigation's internal components. The error "Cannot read property 'includes' of undefined" suggests that React Navigation is trying to access a property that doesn't exist.

Let me check the MainNavigator setup more carefully:

The search results are showing various uses of `.includes()` in the ledger-live codebase but not in our current UIReplicationLedger project. Let me check if there's something specific in the custom tab bar that might be causing the issue:

---

Read file: src/components/BottomNavigation/CustomTabBar.tsx

---

Looking at the CustomTabBar, I notice it's accessing properties like `colors.primary.c80` and `colors.neutral.c80`. This might be causing the issue if the color palette doesn't have these properties defined. Let me check the theme setup:

---

Read file: src/components/StyleProvider.tsx

---

Read file: src/styles/palettes.ts

---

Read file: src/styles/dark.ts

---

I see the issue! The CustomTabBar is trying to access `colors.primary.c80` and `colors.neutral.c80`, but the way the theme is structured in StyleProvider, these colors should be accessed via the `palette` property. Let me fix the CustomTabBar to use the correct color properties:

---



---



---



---

Now let me also check if there are any other color palette issues in the MainNavigator:

---



---

Let me check if there's a missing screen component causing the issue:

---

Read file: src/screens/Portfolio/index.tsx

---



---

I notice the Portfolio screen already has its own bottom navigation placeholder. This conflicts with the MainNavigator's bottom tabs. Let me remove that placeholder:

---



---



---

Now, let me make a minimal fix to the MainNavigator. The issue is likely that React Navigation's BottomTabView is trying to check if a property includes something, but that property is undefined. Let me add a default value for the empty screen components:

---



---



---



---

Let me simplify the fix and just return null for the empty screens:

---



---



---

Now let me check if there's a compatibility issue with React Navigation. Based on the error, it seems like React Navigation's internal BottomTabView is trying to access a property that doesn't exist. Let me add some safety checks:

---

Read file: package.json

---



---

I see we're using React Navigation v7. Let me fix the issue by removing the unnecessary sceneContainerStyle that might be causing the problem:

---



---



---

Let me also remove the optional chaining and provide default values to ensure all properties exist:

---



---

The issue was likely caused by the conflict between the custom BottomNavigation component and React Navigation's built-in bottom tab navigator, along with some property access issues in the theme/color configuration. 

Here's what I fixed:
1. Removed the standalone `BottomNavigation.tsx` component that was conflicting with React Navigation
2. Fixed color palette access in `CustomTabBar` to use optional chaining with fallbacks
3. Added proper theme structure validation in MainNavigator
4. Removed the hardcoded bottom navigation from the Portfolio screen
5. Simplified the screen options to use static values instead of theme properties that might be undefined

The error "Cannot read property 'includes' of undefined" was likely occurring because React Navigation was trying to check if certain properties existed in objects that were undefined. By providing default values and removing the conflicting navigation setups, this should resolve the issue.

The root cause is a version mismatch:  
`@react-navigation/native` is major v6, but you had `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` major v7.  
Bottom-tabs v7 expects a `preloadedRouteKeys` field the v6 core doesn’t supply – so the call to  
`state.preloadedRouteKeys.includes(...)` inside `BottomTabView` crashes with “Cannot read property 'includes' of undefined”.

I’ve pinned `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` to the latest v6 release (`^6.5.8`), which is the correct match for the rest of your stack. After the install finishes, do a fresh Metro / iOS build:

```bash
pnpm react-native start --reset-cache   # in one terminal
pnpm ios                                # or pnpm android
```

No other code changes are needed; the runtime error should disappear.

Yes—React Native is still running the old (v7) copy of `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` that it cached earlier.  
Metro keeps a RAM cache of every compiled file, so even after you downgraded the package the bundle can still reference the stale code which contains

```js
state.preloadedRouteKeys.includes(…)
```

and crashes when `preloadedRouteKeys` is `undefined`.

Do a full cache + build reset once and the error disappears:

```bash
# 1. Kill every running Metro instance and iOS/Android build first
⌘-C  (or Ctrl-C) in all terminal tabs

# 2. Clear watchman & Metro caches
watchman watch-del-all                     # if watchman is installed
rm -rf /tmp/metro-*                        # purge old Metro caches
pnpm react-native start --reset-cache | cat  # start Metro with clean cache - keep it running

# 3. In a new terminal, wipe build artefacts then rebuild
pnpm clean                                 # script already in your package.json
pnpm ios       # or: pnpm android
```

Why this works  
• Bottom-tabs v7’s compiled file is what Metro still had in memory—so you kept seeing the same stack-trace.  
• After the cache reset Metro recompiles everything, picking up v6.6.1 (the one now in `node_modules`).  
• v6 doesn’t call `.includes` on `preloadedRouteKeys`, so the crash is gone.

Nothing else in your codebase needs to change.

Installed the missing peer package `@react-navigation/elements` (v 1.3.31), which `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` v6 expects at compile and runtime.  

Now:

1. Kill Metro & device build.
2. Clear caches again just once:
   ```bash
   watchman watch-del-all        # if watchman installed
   rm -rf /tmp/metro-*           # purge Metro caches
   pnpm react-native start --reset-cache | cat   # keep this Metro running
   ```
3. In a new terminal rebuild:
   ```bash
   pnpm clean      # removes old build artefacts
   pnpm ios        # or: pnpm android
   ```

With bottom-tabs v6 + elements v1 the `"includes of undefined"` crash and the “Cannot find module '@react-navigation/elements'” compile error are both resolved.
