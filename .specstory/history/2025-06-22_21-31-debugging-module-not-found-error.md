Looking at the error, I can see the issue. The linter error shows that `./TabBarShape` module cannot be found, and this is causing the runtime error in the navigation system.

Let me examine the files to understand the problem:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/components/BottomNavigation â€¢ **8** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `index.ts` |
| ðŸ“„ `BottomNavigation.tsx` |
| ðŸ“„ `CustomTabBar.tsx` |
| ðŸ“„ `TransferFAB.tsx` |
| ðŸ“„ `BackgroundGradient.tsx` |
| ðŸ“„ `TabIcons.tsx` |
| ðŸ“„ `TabIcon.tsx` |
| ðŸ“„ `README.md` |

</details>

Now I can see the problem! The issue is in the `index.ts` file. Looking at the directory contents, there's no `TabBarShape.tsx` file, but the index.ts is trying to export it as if it were a separate file.

Looking at the `CustomTabBar.tsx` file, I can see that `TabBarShape` is actually defined **inline** within that file (as indicated by the comment `// INLINE TabBarShape - exactly as in official CustomTabBar.tsx`). It's not meant to be a separate component.

Let me fix the `index.ts` file by removing the incorrect export:

---

```diff
  // Individual components
  export { default as CustomTabBar } from "./CustomTabBar";
- export { default as TabBarShape } from "./TabBarShape";
  export { default as BackgroundGradient } from "./BackgroundGradient";
  export { default as TransferFAB } from "./TransferFAB";
```

Perfect! I've fixed the issue by removing the incorrect export of `TabBarShape` from the `index.ts` file. 

**The Problem:**
- The `index.ts` file was trying to export `TabBarShape` from a file `./TabBarShape.tsx` that doesn't exist
- In reality, `TabBarShape` is defined **inline** within `CustomTabBar.tsx` as an internal component
- This module resolution failure was causing the navigation system to break with the `TypeError: Cannot read property 'includes' of undefined` runtime error

**The Solution:**
- Removed the line `export { default as TabBarShape } from "./TabBarShape";` from the index file
- `TabBarShape` is meant to be an internal component used only within `CustomTabBar.tsx`, not a standalone reusable component

This should resolve both the linter error and the runtime navigation error. The `TabBarShape` component will continue to work perfectly within the `CustomTabBar` component where it's actually defined and used.
