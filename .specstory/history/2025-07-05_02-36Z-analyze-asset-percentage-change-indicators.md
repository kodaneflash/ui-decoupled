# Analyze asset percentage change indicators (2025-07-05 02:36Z)

_**User**_

  look at the upward/downward arrow  (in the image provided its the arrow downwards 1%) next to the main prominent portfolio balance) On the 1d timeframe, it appears to only be taking in account the % upwards/downwards of the bitcoin asset, look at solana  which is down 3 and  bitcoin is down 1 in the assetrows in the image. Analyze the data flow and then determine if it's meant to belike this or if this needs to be fixed @AssetRow.tsx @Delta.tsx @CurrencyUnitValue.tsx @CounterValue.tsx @GraphCard.tsx  @PriceService.ts @PriceContext.tsx @GraphCard.tsx

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the user's query, they're asking about the upward/downward arrow next to the main portfolio balance (the arrow showing 1% down in the image). They've noticed that on the 1d timeframe, it appears to only be taking into account the % upwards/downwards of the bitcoin asset, but they can see in the asset rows that bitcoin is down 1% and solana is down 3%. They want to understand if this is intentional or if it needs to be fixed.

Let me analyze the data flow from the attached files:

1. **GraphCard.tsx** - This is where the main portfolio balance and the delta (arrow + percentage) are shown
2. **Delta.tsx** - This component renders the arrow and percentage
3. **AssetRow.tsx** - This shows individual asset rows with their deltas
4. **PriceService.ts** - This handles the price calculations
5. **PriceContext.tsx** - This provides the price context to components

Let me trace through the data flow:

In **GraphCard.tsx**, I can see there's a `calculatePortfolioChange` function that should calculate the overall portfolio change. Looking at lines 148-187:

```typescript
const calculatePortfolioChange = useCallback(async (): Promise<{ value: number; percentage: number }> => {
  if (loading || areAccountsEmpty) {
    return { value: 0, percentage: 0 };
  }

  let totalCurrentValue = new BigNumber(0);
  let totalChange = new BigNumber(0);

  // Calculate changes for each asset based on the selected timeframe
  for (const asset of CRYPTO_ASSETS) {
    try {
      const cryptoId = asset.id as 'bitcoin' | 'solana';
      const magnitude = asset.currency.units[0].magnitude;
      const balance = new BigNumber(asset.amount);


```

I'm tracing how the function calculates the portfolio's value change. It's iterating through crypto assets, preparing to compute the total current value and changes for the selected timeframe. The code is setting up to calculate individual asset contributions to the overall portfolio performance.

After processing each asset's details, I'll determine the aggregate change percentage by dividing total change by total current value. If the current value is zero, I'll default the percentage to zero to prevent division errors.

The function will return an object with the total value change and percentage, providing a comprehensive view of portfolio performance across the chosen time range.

```

typescript
 changePercentage, // Already in decimal format (0-1)
  };
}, [loading, areAccountsEmpty, calculateFiatValue, getValueChangeForTimeframe, selectedRange]);
```

I notice a potential calculation nuance in the percentage change method that might require further mathematical refinement to accurately represent portfolio performance.

The current implementation divides total change by total current value, which diverges from the standard percentage change formula of `(currentValue - previousValue) / previousValue`. Individual asset calculations in the PriceService.ts actually leverage API-provided percentage changes, suggesting a different computational approach might be more precise.

The percentage calculation needs careful recalibration to ensure it truly reflects the portfolio's value movement across different timeframes and asset types. I'm tracking how percentage calculations flow through the application. The current approach in `GraphCard.tsx` calculates portfolio percentage incorrectly by dividing total change by current value. Instead, it should use a weighted average or calculate percentage based on previous and current total values.

In `AssetRow.tsx`, each asset's percentage comes from its `countervalueChange` property, which attempts to retrieve timeframe-specific data first. If no specific data exists, it falls back to a default value with zero percentage. The code logs these calculations for debugging purposes, showing a careful approach to handling missing or incomplete financial data.

The next step is to trace how these `countervalueChange` values get populated across the application's data flow.</details></think>

Looking at the data flow you've described, I need to analyze how the portfolio-level percentage change (the arrow next to the main balance) is calculated versus how individual asset percentages are calculated. Let me trace through the code to identify the issue.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the data flow more clearly. Let me analyze what's happening:

1. **Individual Asset Rows**: These use `AssetRowLayout` which calculates dynamic countervalue changes based on the selected timeframe via `getValueChangeForTimeframe`. The calculation is done individually for each asset.

2. **Portfolio-level Delta**: This is calculated in `GraphCard.tsx` in the `calculatePortfolioChange` function. 

Looking at the `calculatePortfolioChange` function in `GraphCard.tsx` (lines 115-169), I can see the issue:

```typescript
const calculatePortfolioChange = useCallback(async (): Promise<{ value: number; percentage: number }> => {
  // ... 
  let totalCurrentValue = new BigNumber(0);
  let totalChange = new BigNumber(0);

  // Calculate changes for each asset based on the selected timeframe
  for (const asset of CRYPTO_ASSETS) {
    try {
      const cryptoId = asset.id as 'bitcoin' | 'solana';
      const magnitude = asset.currency.units[0].magnitude;
      const balance = new BigNumber(asset.amount);
      const currentFiatValue = calculateFiatValue(cryptoId, balance, magnitude);
      
      totalCurrentValue = totalCurrentValue.plus(currentFiatValue);
      
      // Get value change for the selected timeframe (not just 24h)
      const valueChangeData = await getValueChangeForTimeframe(
        cryptoId,
        balance,
        selectedRange, // Use the selected timeframe instead of hardcoded 24h
        magnitude
      );
      
      // Add this asset's value change to the total
      totalChange = totalChange.plus(valueChangeData.value);
      
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`[GraphCard] Error calculating ${selectedRange} change for ${asset.id}:`, error);
    }
  }

  const changePercentage = totalCurrentValue.isZero() 
    ? 0 
    : totalChange.dividedBy(totalCurrentValue).toNumber(); // Already as decimal

  return {
    value: totalChange.toNumber(),
    percentage: changePercentage, // Already in decimal format (0-1)
  };
}, [loading, areAccountsEmpty, calculateFiatValue, getValueChangeForTimeframe, selectedRange]);
```

I notice a critical calculation flaw in the percentage change computation. The current method simply divides total change by total current value, which doesn't accurately represent percentage change. This approach fails to capture the true relative movement of the portfolio across different timeframes.

The calculation needs a more nuanced approach that considers the initial value and compares it against the current value to derive a meaningful percentage change. The current implementation might lead to misleading portfolio performance representations.

By using `totalChange / totalCurrentValue`, the calculation deviates from standard financial percentage change formulas, potentially introducing significant distortions in how portfolio performance is interpreted. A correct implementation would require using the initial portfolio value as the denominator, ensuring a mathematically precise representation of value fluctuation.

The discrepancy between individual asset percentages and portfolio percentage hints at potential data synchronization or calculation methodology problems. I'll investigate the data sources and computational approach to pinpoint the root cause of these inconsistent representations.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The grep search doesn't show anything meaningful about the 1d data. Let me search for more specific information about the calculation issue. Let me look at the PriceService to understand how the 1d data is being calculated vs the static data.

I found the issue! In the `calculatePortfolioChange` function in `GraphCard.tsx`, the percentage calculation is incorrect. It's doing:

```typescript
const changePercentage = totalCurrentValue.isZero() 
  ? 0 
  : totalChange.dividedBy(totalCurrentValue).toNumber(); // Already as decimal
```

This is dividing the total change by the current value, which gives `change / currentValue`, but the correct formula for percentage change should be `change / previousValue`.

The correct calculation should be:
```typescript
const totalPreviousValue = totalCurrentValue.minus(totalChange);
const changePercentage = totalPreviousValue.isZero() 
  ? 0 
  : totalChange.dividedBy(totalPreviousValue).toNumber();
```

Let me also check if there are any other issues with the data flow. I noticed that the individual asset rows are using `AssetRowLayout` which has its own calculation logic, while the portfolio uses the `GraphCard` calculation.

Let me look at the static data for the 1d timeframe vs what might be coming from the API.</details></think>

---

Read file: UIReplicationLedger/src/services/PriceService.ts

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the issue clearly! Let me analyze the data flow:

1. **Static Data (HISTORICAL_PRICES)**: 
   - Bitcoin 1d: +1.89%
   - Solana 1d: +1.68%

2. **Fallback Data (getFallbackPrices)**:
   - Bitcoin 1d: +1.89%
   - Solana 1d: +1.68%

3. **Live API Data**: The `calculate24hValueChange` method uses real CoinGecko API data for the 1d timeframe.

4. **User's Observation**: Bitcoin is showing -1% and Solana is showing -3% in the asset rows, which suggests the live API is returning negative values, but the portfolio is showing -1%.

So the issue is:
- **Individual Asset Rows**: These use `AssetRowLayout` which calls `getValueChangeForTimeframe` â†’ `calculate24hValueChange` â†’ Real API data (showing -1% for Bitcoin, -3% for Solana)
- **Portfolio Level**: Uses `GraphCard.calculatePortfolioChange` which also calls `getValueChangeForTimeframe` â†’ `calculate24hValueChange` â†’ Should use the same real API data

But there are TWO issues:

1. **Portfolio Percentage Calculation is Wrong**: The portfolio percentage is calculated as `totalChange / totalCurrentValue`, but it should be `totalChange / totalPreviousValue`.

2. **The portfolio might be showing Bitcoin's percentage instead of the weighted average**: If the portfolio is mostly Bitcoin (higher value), then the portfolio percentage would be dominated by Bitcoin's change.

Let me check the asset amounts to understand the weighting:
- Bitcoin: 83.5206 BTC Ã— ~$97,000 = ~$8.1M
- Solana: 6,247.57 SOL Ã— ~$242 = ~$1.5M

So Bitcoin represents about 84% of the portfolio value, and Solana represents about 16%. 

I'll calculate the weighted average percentage change. With Bitcoin down 1% and Solana down 3%, the weighted calculation reveals a more accurate portfolio performance. The mathematical error in the current calculation skews the true portfolio change, potentially misrepresenting the actual investment performance.</details></think>

Now I can see the issue! Let me analyze the data flow and identify the problem:

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I can see the issue clearly. The data flow shows that both the individual asset rows and the portfolio calculation are using the same data source (live API), but there's a mathematical error in the portfolio percentage calculation.

Let me also check if there could be any timing/caching issues between the asset rows and the portfolio calculation.

Let me examine if there are any other potential issues with the data flow.</details></think>

---

Read file: UIReplicationLedger/src/components/GraphCard.tsx

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I can see the exact issue. Looking at lines 150-169 in GraphCard.tsx:

```typescript
const changePercentage = totalCurrentValue.isZero() 
  ? 0 
  : totalChange.dividedBy(totalCurrentValue).toNumber(); // Already as decimal
```

This is the mathematical error. The percentage should be calculated as:
`changePercentage = totalChange / totalPreviousValue`

But the code is calculating:
`changePercentage = totalChange / totalCurrentValue`

This is incorrect because:
- `totalCurrentValue` is the current portfolio value
- `totalChange` is the dollar amount change 
- `totalPreviousValue` = `totalCurrentValue - totalChange`

The correct percentage change formula is: `(current - previous) / previous * 100`
Which simplifies to: `change / previous * 100`

So the fix should be:
```typescript
const totalPreviousValue = totalCurrentValue.minus(totalChange);
const changePercentage = totalPreviousValue.isZero() 
  ? 0 
  : totalChange.dividedBy(totalPreviousValue).toNumber();
```

Let me fix this issue now.</details></think>

## Analysis

I found the issue! The problem is in the portfolio percentage calculation in `GraphCard.tsx`. Here's what's happening:

**Data Flow:**
1. **Individual Asset Rows**: Use live API data and show correct percentages (-1% for Bitcoin, -3% for Solana)
2. **Portfolio Level**: Uses the same live API data but has a **mathematical error** in the percentage calculation

**The Mathematical Error:**
```typescript
// CURRENT (INCORRECT)
const changePercentage = totalChange.dividedBy(totalCurrentValue).toNumber();

// SHOULD BE (CORRECT)
const totalPreviousValue = totalCurrentValue.minus(totalChange);
const changePercentage = totalChange.dividedBy(totalPreviousValue).toNumber();
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- Portfolio percentage = `change / previousValue` (standard percentage change formula)
- But the code calculates: `change / currentValue` 
- This gives a different result and doesn't represent the true portfolio performance

**Expected Portfolio Calculation:**
- Bitcoin: ~$8.1M (84% of portfolio) at -1%
- Solana: ~$1.5M (16% of portfolio) at -3%
- Weighted average: `(0.84 Ã— -1%) + (0.16 Ã— -3%) = -1.32%`

But due to the mathematical error, the portfolio shows an incorrect percentage.

Let me fix this:

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've fixed the mathematical error in the portfolio percentage calculation. Now the portfolio percentage will be calculated correctly as `change / previousValue` instead of `change / currentValue`.

The fix I applied:
1. Added calculation for `totalPreviousValue = totalCurrentValue - totalChange`
2. Changed the percentage calculation to use `totalPreviousValue` instead of `totalCurrentValue`
3. Added `totalPreviousValue` to the console log for debugging

This should now correctly calculate the portfolio percentage as a weighted average of the individual asset changes. So if Bitcoin is down 1% and Solana is down 3%, the portfolio percentage will properly reflect the weighted average based on their relative values in the portfolio.

The user should now see the correct portfolio percentage that represents the actual performance of their combined assets, rather than the mathematically incorrect calculation that was happening before.</details></think>

---

## Summary

**The Issue Was:** The portfolio percentage calculation in `GraphCard.tsx` was mathematically incorrect.

**Root Cause:** The code was calculating portfolio percentage as `totalChange / totalCurrentValue`, but the correct formula is `totalChange / totalPreviousValue`.

**What I Fixed:**
1. **Corrected the percentage calculation** to use the proper formula: `change / previousValue`
2. **Added `totalPreviousValue` calculation** as `totalCurrentValue - totalChange`
3. **Enhanced logging** to show both current and previous values for debugging

**Result:** Now the portfolio percentage will correctly show the weighted average of all asset changes, rather than being skewed by the mathematical error. If Bitcoin is down 1% and Solana is down 3%, the portfolio will show the proper weighted percentage based on their relative values.

**Technical Details:**
- Bitcoin (~$8.1M, 84% of portfolio) at -1%
- Solana (~$1.5M, 16% of portfolio) at -3%
- Weighted result: `(0.84 Ã— -1%) + (0.16 Ã— -3%) â‰ˆ -1.32%`

The individual asset rows were already working correctly with live API data - the issue was purely in the portfolio-level aggregation calculation.
