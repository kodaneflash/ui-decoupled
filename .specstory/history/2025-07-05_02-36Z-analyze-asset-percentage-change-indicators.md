# Analyze asset percentage change indicators (2025-07-05 02:36Z)

_**User**_

  look at the upward/downward arrow  (in the image provided its the arrow downwards 1%) next to the main prominent portfolio balance) On the 1d timeframe, it appears to only be taking in account the % upwards/downwards of the bitcoin asset, look at solana  which is down 3 and  bitcoin is down 1 in the assetrows in the image. Analyze the data flow and then determine if it's meant to belike this or if this needs to be fixed @AssetRow.tsx @Delta.tsx @CurrencyUnitValue.tsx @CounterValue.tsx @GraphCard.tsx  @PriceService.ts @PriceContext.tsx @GraphCard.tsx

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the user's query, they're asking about the upward/downward arrow next to the main portfolio balance (the arrow showing 1% down in the image). They've noticed that on the 1d timeframe, it appears to only be taking into account the % upwards/downwards of the bitcoin asset, but they can see in the asset rows that bitcoin is down 1% and solana is down 3%. They want to understand if this is intentional or if it needs to be fixed.

Let me analyze the data flow from the attached files:

1. **GraphCard.tsx** - This is where the main portfolio balance and the delta (arrow + percentage) are shown
2. **Delta.tsx** - This component renders the arrow and percentage
3. **AssetRow.tsx** - This shows individual asset rows with their deltas
4. **PriceService.ts** - This handles the price calculations
5. **PriceContext.tsx** - This provides the price context to components

Let me trace through the data flow:

In **GraphCard.tsx**, I can see there's a `calculatePortfolioChange` function that should calculate the overall portfolio change. Looking at lines 148-187:

```typescript
const calculatePortfolioChange = useCallback(async (): Promise<{ value: number; percentage: number }> => {
  if (loading || areAccountsEmpty) {
    return { value: 0, percentage: 0 };
  }

  let totalCurrentValue = new BigNumber(0);
  let totalChange = new BigNumber(0);

  // Calculate changes for each asset based on the selected timeframe
  for (const asset of CRYPTO_ASSETS) {
    try {
      const cryptoId = asset.id as 'bitcoin' | 'solana';
      const magnitude = asset.currency.units[0].magnitude;
      const balance = new BigNumber(asset.amount);


```

I'm tracing how the function calculates the portfolio's value change. It's iterating through crypto assets, preparing to compute the total current value and changes for the selected timeframe. The code is setting up to calculate individual asset contributions to the overall portfolio performance.

After processing each asset's details, I'll determine the aggregate change percentage by dividing total change by total current value. If the current value is zero, I'll default the percentage to zero to prevent division errors.

The function will return an object with the total value change and percentage, providing a comprehensive view of portfolio performance across the chosen time range.

```

typescript
 changePercentage, // Already in decimal format (0-1)
  };
}, [loading, areAccountsEmpty, calculateFiatValue, getValueChangeForTimeframe, selectedRange]);
```

I notice a potential calculation nuance in the percentage change method that might require further mathematical refinement to accurately represent portfolio performance.

The current implementation divides total change by total current value, which diverges from the standard percentage change formula of `(currentValue - previousValue) / previousValue`. Individual asset calculations in the PriceService.ts actually leverage API-provided percentage changes, suggesting a different computational approach might be more precise.

The percentage calculation needs careful recalibration to ensure it truly reflects the portfolio's value movement across different timeframes and asset types. I'm tracking how percentage calculations flow through the application. The current approach in `GraphCard.tsx` calculates portfolio percentage incorrectly by dividing total change by current value. Instead, it should use a weighted average or calculate percentage based on previous and current total values.

In `AssetRow.tsx`, each asset's percentage comes from its `countervalueChange` property, which attempts to retrieve timeframe-specific data first. If no specific data exists, it falls back to a default value with zero percentage. The code logs these calculations for debugging purposes, showing a careful approach to handling missing or incomplete financial data.

The next step is to trace how these `countervalueChange` values get populated across the application's data flow.</details></think>

Looking at the data flow you've described, I need to analyze how the portfolio-level percentage change (the arrow next to the main balance) is calculated versus how individual asset percentages are calculated. Let me trace through the code to identify the issue.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the data flow more clearly. Let me analyze what's happening:

1. **Individual Asset Rows**: These use `AssetRowLayout` which calculates dynamic countervalue changes based on the selected timeframe via `getValueChangeForTimeframe`. The calculation is done individually for each asset.

2. **Portfolio-level Delta**: This is calculated in `GraphCard.tsx` in the `calculatePortfolioChange` function. 

Looking at the `calculatePortfolioChange` function in `GraphCard.tsx` (lines 115-169), I can see the issue:

```typescript
const calculatePortfolioChange = useCallback(async (): Promise<{ value: number; percentage: number }> => {
  // ... 
  let totalCurrentValue = new BigNumber(0);
  let totalChange = new BigNumber(0);

  // Calculate changes for each asset based on the selected timeframe
  for (const asset of CRYPTO_ASSETS) {
    try {
      const cryptoId = asset.id as 'bitcoin' | 'solana';
      const magnitude = asset.currency.units[0].magnitude;
      const balance = new BigNumber(asset.amount);
      const currentFiatValue = calculateFiatValue(cryptoId, balance, magnitude);
      
      totalCurrentValue = totalCurrentValue.plus(currentFiatValue);
      
      // Get value change for the selected timeframe (not just 24h)
      const valueChangeData = await getValueChangeForTimeframe(
        cryptoId,
        balance,
        selectedRange, // Use the selected timeframe instead of hardcoded 24h
        magnitude
      );
      
      // Add this asset's value change to the total
      totalChange = totalChange.plus(valueChangeData.value);
      
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`[GraphCard] Error calculating ${selectedRange} change for ${asset.id}:`, error);
    }
  }

  const changePercentage = totalCurrentValue.isZero() 
    ? 0 
    : totalChange.dividedBy(totalCurrentValue).toNumber(); // Already as decimal

  return {
    value: totalChange.toNumber(),
    percentage: changePercentage, // Already in decimal format (0-1)
  };
}, [loading, areAccountsEmpty, calculateFiatValue, getValueChangeForTimeframe, selectedRange]);
```

I notice a critical calculation flaw in the percentage change computation. The current method simply divides total change by total current value, which doesn't accurately represent percentage change. This approach fails to capture the true relative movement of the portfolio across different timeframes.

The calculation needs a more nuanced approach that considers the initial value and compares it against the current value to derive a meaningful percentage change. The current implementation might lead to misleading portfolio performance representations.

By using `totalChange / totalCurrentValue`, the calculation deviates from standard financial percentage change formulas, potentially introducing significant distortions in how portfolio performance is interpreted. A correct implementation would require using the initial portfolio value as the denominator, ensuring a mathematically precise representation of value fluctuation.

The discrepancy between individual asset percentages and portfolio percentage hints at potential data synchronization or calculation methodology problems. I'll investigate the data sources and computational approach to pinpoint the root cause of these inconsistent representations.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The grep search doesn't show anything meaningful about the 1d data. Let me search for more specific information about the calculation issue. Let me look at the PriceService to understand how the 1d data is being calculated vs the static data.

I found the issue! In the `calculatePortfolioChange` function in `GraphCard.tsx`, the percentage calculation is incorrect. It's doing:

```typescript
const changePercentage = totalCurrentValue.isZero() 
  ? 0 
  : totalChange.dividedBy(totalCurrentValue).toNumber(); // Already as decimal
```

This is dividing the total change by the current value, which gives `change / currentValue`, but the correct formula for percentage change should be `change / previousValue`.

The correct calculation should be:
```typescript
const totalPreviousValue = totalCurrentValue.minus(totalChange);
const changePercentage = totalPreviousValue.isZero() 
  ? 0 
  : totalChange.dividedBy(totalPreviousValue).toNumber();
```

Let me also check if there are any other issues with the data flow. I noticed that the individual asset rows are using `AssetRowLayout` which has its own calculation logic, while the portfolio uses the `GraphCard` calculation.

Let me look at the static data for the 1d timeframe vs what might be coming from the API.</details></think>

---

Read file: UIReplicationLedger/src/services/PriceService.ts

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the issue clearly! Let me analyze the data flow:

1. **Static Data (HISTORICAL_PRICES)**: 
   - Bitcoin 1d: +1.89%
   - Solana 1d: +1.68%

2. **Fallback Data (getFallbackPrices)**:
   - Bitcoin 1d: +1.89%
   - Solana 1d: +1.68%

3. **Live API Data**: The `calculate24hValueChange` method uses real CoinGecko API data for the 1d timeframe.

4. **User's Observation**: Bitcoin is showing -1% and Solana is showing -3% in the asset rows, which suggests the live API is returning negative values, but the portfolio is showing -1%.

So the issue is:
- **Individual Asset Rows**: These use `AssetRowLayout` which calls `getValueChangeForTimeframe` → `calculate24hValueChange` → Real API data (showing -1% for Bitcoin, -3% for Solana)
- **Portfolio Level**: Uses `GraphCard.calculatePortfolioChange` which also calls `getValueChangeForTimeframe` → `calculate24hValueChange` → Should use the same real API data

But there are TWO issues:

1. **Portfolio Percentage Calculation is Wrong**: The portfolio percentage is calculated as `totalChange / totalCurrentValue`, but it should be `totalChange / totalPreviousValue`.

2. **The portfolio might be showing Bitcoin's percentage instead of the weighted average**: If the portfolio is mostly Bitcoin (higher value), then the portfolio percentage would be dominated by Bitcoin's change.

Let me check the asset amounts to understand the weighting:
- Bitcoin: 83.5206 BTC × ~$97,000 = ~$8.1M
- Solana: 6,247.57 SOL × ~$242 = ~$1.5M

So Bitcoin represents about 84% of the portfolio value, and Solana represents about 16%. 

I'll calculate the weighted average percentage change. With Bitcoin down 1% and Solana down 3%, the weighted calculation reveals a more accurate portfolio performance. The mathematical error in the current calculation skews the true portfolio change, potentially misrepresenting the actual investment performance.</details></think>

Now I can see the issue! Let me analyze the data flow and identify the problem:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I can see the issue clearly. The data flow shows that both the individual asset rows and the portfolio calculation are using the same data source (live API), but there's a mathematical error in the portfolio percentage calculation.

Let me also check if there could be any timing/caching issues between the asset rows and the portfolio calculation.

Let me examine if there are any other potential issues with the data flow.</details></think>

---

Read file: UIReplicationLedger/src/components/GraphCard.tsx

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I can see the exact issue. Looking at lines 150-169 in GraphCard.tsx:

```typescript
const changePercentage = totalCurrentValue.isZero() 
  ? 0 
  : totalChange.dividedBy(totalCurrentValue).toNumber(); // Already as decimal
```

This is the mathematical error. The percentage should be calculated as:
`changePercentage = totalChange / totalPreviousValue`

But the code is calculating:
`changePercentage = totalChange / totalCurrentValue`

This is incorrect because:
- `totalCurrentValue` is the current portfolio value
- `totalChange` is the dollar amount change 
- `totalPreviousValue` = `totalCurrentValue - totalChange`

The correct percentage change formula is: `(current - previous) / previous * 100`
Which simplifies to: `change / previous * 100`

So the fix should be:
```typescript
const totalPreviousValue = totalCurrentValue.minus(totalChange);
const changePercentage = totalPreviousValue.isZero() 
  ? 0 
  : totalChange.dividedBy(totalPreviousValue).toNumber();
```

Let me fix this issue now.</details></think>

## Analysis

I found the issue! The problem is in the portfolio percentage calculation in `GraphCard.tsx`. Here's what's happening:

**Data Flow:**
1. **Individual Asset Rows**: Use live API data and show correct percentages (-1% for Bitcoin, -3% for Solana)
2. **Portfolio Level**: Uses the same live API data but has a **mathematical error** in the percentage calculation

**The Mathematical Error:**
```typescript
// CURRENT (INCORRECT)
const changePercentage = totalChange.dividedBy(totalCurrentValue).toNumber();

// SHOULD BE (CORRECT)
const totalPreviousValue = totalCurrentValue.minus(totalChange);
const changePercentage = totalChange.dividedBy(totalPreviousValue).toNumber();
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- Portfolio percentage = `change / previousValue` (standard percentage change formula)
- But the code calculates: `change / currentValue` 
- This gives a different result and doesn't represent the true portfolio performance

**Expected Portfolio Calculation:**
- Bitcoin: ~$8.1M (84% of portfolio) at -1%
- Solana: ~$1.5M (16% of portfolio) at -3%
- Weighted average: `(0.84 × -1%) + (0.16 × -3%) = -1.32%`

But due to the mathematical error, the portfolio shows an incorrect percentage.

Let me fix this:

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've fixed the mathematical error in the portfolio percentage calculation. Now the portfolio percentage will be calculated correctly as `change / previousValue` instead of `change / currentValue`.

The fix I applied:
1. Added calculation for `totalPreviousValue = totalCurrentValue - totalChange`
2. Changed the percentage calculation to use `totalPreviousValue` instead of `totalCurrentValue`
3. Added `totalPreviousValue` to the console log for debugging

This should now correctly calculate the portfolio percentage as a weighted average of the individual asset changes. So if Bitcoin is down 1% and Solana is down 3%, the portfolio percentage will properly reflect the weighted average based on their relative values in the portfolio.

The user should now see the correct portfolio percentage that represents the actual performance of their combined assets, rather than the mathematically incorrect calculation that was happening before.</details></think>

---

## Summary

**The Issue Was:** The portfolio percentage calculation in `GraphCard.tsx` was mathematically incorrect.

**Root Cause:** The code was calculating portfolio percentage as `totalChange / totalCurrentValue`, but the correct formula is `totalChange / totalPreviousValue`.

**What I Fixed:**
1. **Corrected the percentage calculation** to use the proper formula: `change / previousValue`
2. **Added `totalPreviousValue` calculation** as `totalCurrentValue - totalChange`
3. **Enhanced logging** to show both current and previous values for debugging

**Result:** Now the portfolio percentage will correctly show the weighted average of all asset changes, rather than being skewed by the mathematical error. If Bitcoin is down 1% and Solana is down 3%, the portfolio will show the proper weighted percentage based on their relative values.

**Technical Details:**
- Bitcoin (~$8.1M, 84% of portfolio) at -1%
- Solana (~$1.5M, 16% of portfolio) at -3%
- Weighted result: `(0.84 × -1%) + (0.16 × -3%) ≈ -1.32%`

The individual asset rows were already working correctly with live API data - the issue was purely in the portfolio-level aggregation calculation.

_**User**_

its showing solana down 2 and bitcoin down 1 in the assetrows, and still showing down 1 overall in main portfolio weighted percentage for 1d ttimeframe, can you identify if is this intended by analyzing related components in the ledger-live-mobile directory to preserve 100% fidelity? if it is, then leave it unchanged

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to analyze the official ledger-live-mobile codebase to see if the portfolio percentage calculation is intended to behave differently from what I would expect mathematically. They want me to check if the current behavior (showing -1% overall when Bitcoin is -1% and Solana is -2%) is actually correct according to the official Ledger Live implementation.

Let me search through the ledger-live-mobile directory to understand how the portfolio percentage is calculated in the official implementation.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The official ledger-live implementation is very complex, but let me look at the key parts of the portfolio percentage calculation. I found some crucial information:

1. In the `getBalanceHistoryWithChanges` function:
```typescript
countervalueChange: {
  value: (to.countervalue || 0) - (from.countervalue || 0),
  percentage: meaningfulPercentage(
    (to.countervalue || 0) - (from.countervalue || 0),
    from.countervalue,
  ),
},
```

This shows that the percentage is calculated as `change / from.countervalue`, which is the correct mathematical approach.

2. In the `getCurrencyPortfolio` function:
```typescript
const countervalueChange = {
  value: (to.countervalue || 0) - (from.countervalue || 0),
  percentage: meaningfulPercentage(
    (to.countervalue || 0) - (from.countervalue || 0),
    from.countervalue,
  ),
};
```

Again, this confirms the correct approach.

But wait, let me look at the `getPortfolio` function which handles the main portfolio calculation:

```typescript
const [countervalueChangeValue, countervalueReceiveSum, countervalueSendSum] = availables.reduce(
  (sums, { changes }) => {
    const { countervalueChange, countervalueReceiveSum, countervalueSendSum } = changes(
      firstSignificantHistoryIndex,
    );
    return [
      sums[0] + countervalueChange.value,
      sums[1] + countervalueReceiveSum,
      sums[2] + countervalueSendSum,
    ];
  },
  [0, 0, 0],
);

// in case there were no receive, we just track the market change


```

I notice an experimental approach for calculating the balance divider. The implementation uses an environment-specific condition to determine the denominator. When the experimental ROI calculation is enabled, it chooses between `countervalueReceiveSum` and `firstSignificantHistoryValue + countervalueSendSum`. This suggests a nuanced method for tracking portfolio changes, especially in scenarios with minimal or no received assets.

The calculation aims to provide a meaningful percentage change by carefully selecting the most appropriate baseline value for comparison. It's a sophisticated approach that adapts to different portfolio scenarios.

The `meaningfulPercentage` function performs a simple division, calculating the percentage change relative to the historical balance. It includes a safeguard against extreme percentage values by setting a high threshold, ensuring more realistic percentage representations.

```

typescript
function meaningfulPercentage(
  deltaChange: number | null | undefined,
  balanceDivider: number | null | undefined,
  percentageHighThreshold = 100000,
): number | null | undefined {
  if (deltaChange && balanceDivider && balanceDivider !== 0) {
    const percent = deltaChange / balanceDivider;

    if (percent < percentageHighThreshold) {
      return percent;
    }
  }
}
```

I'm investigating why the percentage calculation isn't matching expectations, particularly when Bitcoin and Solana show different change percentages. The `getPortfolio` function's aggregation method seems crucial to understanding this discrepancy.

The calculation involves summing individual account value changes and dividing by the total historical account values, which suggests a complex aggregation process that might not simply average individual asset percentages.

I need to verify the exact implementation details to pinpoint where the calculation diverges from the expected result.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I understand the official Ledger Live implementation! The key insights are:

1. **Portfolio percentage calculation in official Ledger Live:**
   - It uses `firstSignificantHistoryValue` as the denominator (this is the historical portfolio value)
   - It sums up all individual account value changes
   - Formula: `(sum of all account value changes) / firstSignificantHistoryValue`

2. **Individual account percentage calculation:**
   - Uses `from.countervalue` as the denominator (historical account value)
   - Formula: `(account value change) / from.countervalue`

3. **Key difference:**
   - Portfolio percentage is NOT a weighted average of individual account percentages
   - Portfolio percentage is calculated directly from the portfolio's historical value
   - This can lead to different results than a weighted average

The official implementation shows that the portfolio percentage and individual asset percentages are calculated differently by design. The portfolio percentage is based on the portfolio's own historical balance, while individual asset percentages are based on each asset's historical balance.

So if the user is seeing Bitcoin -1%, Solana -2%, but portfolio -1%, this could be correct behavior depending on:
1. The historical portfolio balance vs current portfolio balance
2. The historical individual asset balances vs current individual asset balances
3. The actual API price changes for each asset

The behavior the user is seeing might actually be correct according to the official implementation. The portfolio percentage is not necessarily a weighted average of individual asset percentages.

Let me check if the user's current implementation matches the official logic or if there's still a mathematical error.</details></think>

Based on my analysis of the official Ledger Live implementation, I can now provide you with the correct answer.

## The Behavior is **INTENTIONAL** and **CORRECT**

After analyzing the official `ledger-live/libs/live-countervalues/src/portfolio.ts`, I found that the portfolio percentage calculation is **deliberately different** from individual asset percentages. Here's why:

### Official Ledger Live Logic:

1. **Individual Asset Percentages**: 
   - Formula: `(currentValue - historicalValue) / historicalValue`
   - Each asset calculates its own percentage based on its own historical balance

2. **Portfolio Percentage**: 
   - Formula: `(totalPortfolioChange) / firstSignificantHistoryValue`
   - Uses the portfolio's own historical balance as the denominator
   - **NOT** a weighted average of individual asset percentages

### Key Evidence from Official Code:

```typescript
// From portfolio.ts - Individual account calculation
countervalueChange: {
  value: (to.countervalue || 0) - (from.countervalue || 0),
  percentage: meaningfulPercentage(
    (to.countervalue || 0) - (from.countervalue || 0),
    from.countervalue, // Uses individual account's historical value
  ),
},

// Portfolio calculation
const balanceDivider = firstSignificantHistoryValue; // Portfolio's historical value
return {
  countervalueChange: {
    percentage: meaningfulPercentage(countervalueChangeValue, balanceDivider),
    value: countervalueChangeValue,
  },
};
```

### Why This Happens:

- Bitcoin: -1% means its individual historical value decreased by 1%
- Solana: -2% means its individual historical value decreased by 2%  
- Portfolio: -1% means the **total portfolio's historical value** decreased by 1%

The portfolio percentage reflects the **overall portfolio performance** rather than a simple weighted average of individual assets.

### Recommendation:

**LEAVE THE CODE UNCHANGED** - The behavior you're seeing matches the official Ledger Live implementation exactly. The portfolio percentage is not meant to be a weighted average of individual asset percentages; it's calculated based on the portfolio's own historical balance.

My previous fix was actually correct in terms of the mathematical formula (`change / previousValue`), but the behavior you're observing is the intended design of Ledger Live.

_**User**_

so it shouldnt be adding the % downwards of both assets, solana and bitcoin (sol 2 and btc 1) and then  combining the values to show '3'? 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about why the portfolio percentage isn't showing a combined/weighted percentage based on the individual asset percentages. They're seeing:

- Bitcoin: -1%
- Solana: -2%  
- Portfolio: -1%

And they're wondering why it's not showing something like -3% or a weighted average.

Based on my analysis of the official Ledger Live code, I can see that the portfolio percentage calculation is NOT a simple addition or weighted average of individual asset percentages. Let me explain this clearly.

The official Ledger Live logic works like this:

1. **Individual Asset Percentages**: Each asset calculates its own percentage based on its own historical balance
   - Bitcoin: (currentBTCValue - historicalBTCValue) / historicalBTCValue = -1%
   - Solana: (currentSOLValue - historicalSOLValue) / historicalSOLValue = -2%

2. **Portfolio Percentage**: The portfolio calculates its percentage based on the TOTAL portfolio's historical balance
   - Portfolio: (totalCurrentValue - totalHistoricalValue) / totalHistoricalValue = -1%

The key insight is that the portfolio percentage represents how much the ENTIRE portfolio has changed as a whole, not the sum or average of individual asset changes.

Here's a simple example:
- Yesterday: Bitcoin was worth $8M, Solana was worth $1M, Total = $9M
- Today: Bitcoin is worth $7.92M (-1%), Solana is worth $0.98M (-2%), Total = $8.9M
- Portfolio change: ($8.9M - $9M) / $9M = -1.11%

The portfolio percentage reflects the overall portfolio performance, which is influenced by the weight of each asset. Since Bitcoin represents ~89% of the portfolio value, its -1% change has much more impact on the overall portfolio than Solana's -2% change.

So no, it should NOT be adding the percentages together. 

The implementation aligns precisely with standard financial reporting methods, accurately representing the holistic portfolio performance.</details></think>

---

No, it should **NOT** be adding the percentages together. The current behavior is **correct** according to the official Ledger Live implementation.

Here's why:

## Portfolio Percentage ≠ Sum of Individual Asset Percentages

The portfolio percentage represents **how much the entire portfolio value has changed**, not the sum or average of individual asset percentages.

### Example with Your Data:

Let's say:
- **Bitcoin**: $9,017,635 (≈90% of portfolio) at -1%
- **Solana**: $923,953 (≈10% of portfolio) at -2%  
- **Total Portfolio**: $9,941,588

### Yesterday's Values (approximate):
- Bitcoin: $9,017,635 ÷ 0.99 = $9,108,722
- Solana: $923,953 ÷ 0.98 = $942,807
- **Total Yesterday**: $10,051,529

### Portfolio Change Calculation:
```
Portfolio % = (Today - Yesterday) / Yesterday
Portfolio % = ($9,941,588 - $10,051,529) / $10,051,529
Portfolio % = -$109,941 / $10,051,529 = -1.09%
```

### Why Not -3%?

The portfolio percentage is **weighted by asset value**, not a simple sum:
- Bitcoin's -1% affects 90% of the portfolio = -0.9% impact
- Solana's -2% affects 10% of the portfolio = -0.2% impact
- **Total Impact**: -0.9% + -0.2% = -1.1% (approximately)

### Official Ledger Live Logic:

From the official code, the portfolio calculates:
```typescript
// Portfolio percentage = total portfolio change / total historical portfolio value
percentage: meaningfulPercentage(countervalueChangeValue, balanceDivider)
```

**This is the correct behavior** - it shows how much your overall portfolio value has changed, which is what matters for your total wealth tracking.

The individual asset percentages help you understand which assets are performing better or worse, but the portfolio percentage shows your **actual financial performance**.
