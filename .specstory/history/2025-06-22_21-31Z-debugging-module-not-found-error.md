<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the error, I can see:

1. There's a linter error saying `Cannot find module './TabBarShape' or its corresponding type declarations.` in the index.ts file
2. There's a runtime error `TypeError: Cannot read property 'includes' of undefined` in the BottomTabView

Looking at the attached files, I can see that in `UIReplicationLedger/src/components/BottomNavigation/index.ts`, line 7 is trying to export:

```typescript
export { default as TabBarShape } from "./TabBarShape";
```

But looking at the `CustomTabBar.tsx` file, I can see that `TabBarShape` is actually defined inline within that file, not as a separate file. Here's the relevant code:

```typescript
// INLINE TabBarShape - exactly as in official CustomTabBar.tsx
function TabBarShape({ color }: SvgProps) {
  return (
    <Svg width={375} height={TAB_BAR_HEIGHT} viewBox={`0 0 375 ${TAB_BAR_HEIGHT}`} fill="none">
      <Path d="M0 0H80V56H0V0Z" fill={color} />
      <Path
        d="M80 0H130.836C140.091 0 148.208 6.17679 150.676 15.097L151.848 19.3368C156.369 35.6819 171.243 47 188.202 47C205.439 47 220.484 35.3142 224.748 18.6125L225.645 15.097C227.913 6.21473 235.914 0 245.081 0H295V56H80V0Z"
        fill={color}
      />
      <Path d="M295 0H375V56H295V0Z" fill={color} />
    </Svg>
  );
}
```

The problem stems from an incorrect module export in the index file. I'll remove the non-existent TabBarShape export to resolve the linter and runtime errors.</details></think>

Looking at the error, I can see the issue. The linter error shows that `./TabBarShape` module cannot be found, and this is causing the runtime error in the navigation system.

Let me examine the files to understand the problem:

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/components/BottomNavigation â€¢ **8** results</summary>
        
| Name |

</details>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see that there's no `TabBarShape.tsx` file in the directory. Looking at the `CustomTabBar.tsx` file I can see that `TabBarShape` is defined inline within that file as a function component, not as a separate exported component.

The problem is in the `index.ts` file on line 7 where it's trying to export:
```typescript
export { default as TabBarShape } from "./TabBarShape";
```

But the file `./TabBarShape.tsx` doesn't exist. Instead, `TabBarShape` is defined inline within `CustomTabBar.tsx`.

I need to remove this export from the index.ts file since `TabBarShape` is not meant to be a separate reusable component - it's specifically designed for the CustomTabBar.</details></think>

---

Now I can see the problem! The issue is in the `index.ts` file. Looking at the directory contents, there's no `TabBarShape.tsx` file, but the index.ts is trying to export it as if it were a separate file.

Looking at the `CustomTabBar.tsx` file, I can see that `TabBarShape` is actually defined **inline** within that file (as indicated by the comment `// INLINE TabBarShape - exactly as in official CustomTabBar.tsx`). It's not meant to be a separate component.

Let me fix the `index.ts` file by removing the incorrect export:

---

```diff
  // Individual components
  export { default as CustomTabBar } from "./CustomTabBar";
- export { default as TabBarShape } from "./TabBarShape";
  export { default as BackgroundGradient } from "./BackgroundGradient";
  export { default as TransferFAB } from "./TransferFAB";
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've removed the incorrect export of `TabBarShape` from the index.ts file. This should fix both the linter error and the runtime error.

The reason this was causing the runtime error `TypeError: Cannot read property 'includes' of undefined` is because when the module resolution fails (trying to import a non-existent file), it can cause the entire navigation system to break, as the React Navigation system depends on the bottom tab components being properly loaded.

Since `TabBarShape` is defined inline within `CustomTabBar.tsx` and is only used internally by that component, it shouldn't be exported at all. The CustomTabBar component itself is what should be exported and used.

Let me verify that the fix is correct by checking if there are any other references to TabBarShape that might need to be addressed.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've fixed the issue by removing the incorrect export of `TabBarShape` from the `index.ts` file. 

**The Problem:**
- The `index.ts` file was trying to export `TabBarShape` from a file `./TabBarShape.tsx` that doesn't exist
- In reality, `TabBarShape` is defined **inline** within `CustomTabBar.tsx` as an internal component
- This module resolution failure was causing the navigation system to break with the `TypeError: Cannot read property 'includes' of undefined` runtime error

**The Solution:**
- Removed the line `export { default as TabBarShape } from "./TabBarShape";` from the index file
- `TabBarShape` is meant to be an internal component used only within `CustomTabBar.tsx`, not a standalone reusable component

This should resolve both the linter error and the runtime navigation error. The `TabBarShape` component will continue to work perfectly within the `CustomTabBar` component where it's actually defined and used.
