# Analyze UI component positioning for fidelity (2025-06-22 18:08:42)

_**User**_

You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, and UI design.  Please analyze the given image with our UI on the left and Ledger Wallet's official app on the right. Identify the reasons for the higher positioning of different components in our UI compared to the official app when replicating it for 100% fidelity. Determine the root cause, such as the height of our individual asset rows being too tall, leading to the elevation of other components. This might be due to the identical height of different components like quick actions. Then, using ONLY code and styling from the official apps/ledger-live-mobile for 100% fidelity, make the necessary modifications to align our components with the real Ledger Wallet components. Ensure that our header component (containing the text wallet, crypto, market, and the 4 icons on the top right) is positioned correctly. Keep the bottom navigation menu unchanged. Identify the culprit.

I'll analyze the positioning differences between our UI and the official Ledger Live app to identify why components are positioned higher in our implementation.
