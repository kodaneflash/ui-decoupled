<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has a workspace with two directories:
1. UIReplicationLedger (main one)
2. ledger-live-mobile

They want to disable all indexing and add gitignore for the ledger-live-mobile directory. Looking at the project layout, I can see there's a top-level directory called "ledger-live" which contains various subdirectories including "apps/ledger-live-mobile/".

To achieve what the user wants, I need to:
1. Add the ledger-live directory (or specifically ledger-live-mobile) to .gitignore
2. Potentially add it to other ignore files that might affect indexing (like for IDEs)

Let me first check if there's already a .gitignore file in the workspace, and then add the appropriate entries.</details></think>

I'll help you disable indexing and add gitignore for the ledger-live directory. Let me first check if there's already a .gitignore file and then add the appropriate entries.
