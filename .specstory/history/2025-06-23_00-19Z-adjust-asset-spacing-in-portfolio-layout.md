<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to fix spacing issues in their asset list components by matching the spacing used in Ledger Live Mobile. Let me analyze the provided files to understand the current implementation and compare it with the official Ledger Live Mobile spacing.

From the attached files, I can see:

1. **Official Ledger Live AssetRowLayout.tsx** (from ledger-live/apps/ledger-live-mobile/src/components/AssetRowLayout.tsx):
   - Uses `pt={topLink ? 0 : 6}` and `pb={bottomLink ? 0 : 6}` for padding
   - This means 6 units of padding (which translates to 24px in the @ledgerhq/native-ui spacing system)
   - The component has height that's computed from the padding and content

2. **Current implementation in UIReplicationLedger**:
   - AssetsList.tsx uses `py={3}` and `height={72}` 
   - AssetsListView.tsx uses `marginVertical: 12` and `minHeight: 48` 
   - AssetRowLayout.tsx (their custom version) doesn't seem to be using the same spacing as the official one

Let me look at the official Ledger Live spacing more carefully:

From the official AssetRowLayout.tsx:
```typescript
<Flex flexDirection="row" pt={topLink ? 0 : 6} pb={bottomLink ? 0 : 6} alignItems="center">
```

This uses pt={6} and pb={6}, which in the @ledgerhq/native-ui spacing system equals 24px top and bottom padding.

The space[4] mentioned in the linking lines is 16px.

Let me also check what the current implementations are doing wrong and provide a comprehensive fix.

Looking at the user's current AssetsList.tsx:
- Uses `py={3}` (12px padding) and `height={72}`


- The padding is significantly less than the official 24px vertical padding

The current implementation's vertical spacing is inconsistent with the official Ledger Live Mobile design. The padding is half the recommended size, which could impact the visual consistency and user experience. I'll need to adjust the padding to match the 24px vertical spacing used in the official implementation.

The total row height calculation reveals a discrepancy: the official design uses approximately 80px total height (32px content + 48px padding), while the current implementation uses a fixed 72px height. This suggests the need for a more dynamic approach to component sizing that matches the official design's spacing principles.</details></think>

I'll analyze the spacing used in Ledger Live Mobile and fix the excessive spacing in your asset components. Let me first examine the official Ledger Live spacing patterns and then identify the issues in your current implementation.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I have a much clearer picture of the spacing issues. Let me analyze the official Ledger Live Mobile spacing patterns vs the current implementation:

## Official Ledger Live Mobile Spacing (from the search results):

1. **AssetRowLayout.tsx** (Official):
   - Uses `pt={topLink ? 0 : 6}` and `pb={bottomLink ? 0 : 6}` 
   - This is 6 units = 24px top and bottom padding
   - Total vertical padding per row: 48px
   - Icon size: 32px (from the search results)
   - Uses `ml={4}` for icon spacing (16px)

2. **UI Native spacing system**:
   - From `space = [0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80, 96, 120]`
   - Index 6 = 24px
   - Index 4 = 16px

3. **Design tokens**:
   ```
   "spacing-xs": "8px",      // 2 units
   "spacing-s": "16px",      // 4 units  
   "spacing-m": "24px",      // 6 units
   "spacing-l": "32px",      // 8 units
   "spacing-xl": "40px",     // 10 units
   "spacing-xxs": "12px",    // 3 units
   "spacing-xxxs": "4px",    // 1 unit
   ```

## Current Implementation Issues:

1. **AssetsList.tsx**:
   - Uses `py={3}` (12px) instead of official `pt={6} pb={6}` (48px total)
   - Fixed height of 72px which may be causing issues
   - Icon spacing `mr={3}` (12px) instead of official `ml={4}` (16px)
   
I'm noticing additional inconsistencies in the implementation. The AssetsListView and AssetRowLayout components reveal more spacing discrepancies. The vertical margins and minimum heights are creating conflicts across different components. The estimated item height and icon sizes don't align with the official design specifications, which suggests a systematic approach to spacing is missing.

The core problem appears to be a lack of consistent design token implementation. Different components are using varying spacing values, leading to visual and layout inconsistencies. The misalignment between official design guidelines and current implementation creates potential usability and aesthetic issues.</details></think>

Now let me examine your current AssetRowLayout to see the exact spacing being used:

Read file: UIReplicationLedger/src/components/AssetRowLayout.tsx

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the issue clearly. Looking at the current implementation vs the official Ledger Live Mobile implementation:

## Current Issues Identified:

1. **AssetRowLayout.tsx** (Current - mostly correct):
   - ✅ Uses `pt={topLink ? 0 : 6} pb={bottomLink ? 0 : 6}` - this is correct
   - ✅ Uses `ml={4}` for icon spacing - this is correct
   - ❌ Uses `minHeight={48}` - this might be creating issues
   - ❌ Uses icon `size={40}` - official uses 32px
   - ❌ Uses `marginLeft="21px"` for link line - should be calculated properly

2. **AssetsListView.tsx** (Main problem):
   - ❌ Uses `marginVertical: 12` - this adds extra 24px spacing per item
   - ❌ Uses `ESTIMATED_ITEM_HEIGHT = 72` - this is likely wrong
   - ❌ Uses `minHeight: 48` - conflicts with AssetRowLayout

3. **AssetsList.tsx** (Simple version - has issues):
   - ❌ Uses `py={3}` (12px) instead of letting AssetRowLayout handle spacing
   - ❌ Uses fixed `height={72}` 
   - ❌ Uses `mr={3}` (12px) instead of `ml={4}` (16px)

## Official Ledger Live Mobile Standards:

Based on the search results from the official code:
- **Vertical Padding**: `pt={6} pb={6}` (24px each = 48px total per row)
- **Icon Size**: 32px (from official AssetRowLayout)
- **Icon Spacing**: `ml={4}` (16px)
- **No fixed heights** - let content determine size


- **No extra margins** - only the padding from the row layout

I'll focus on precise adjustments to align with the official design standards. The key is removing unnecessary fixed dimensions and letting the content naturally define the layout. By standardizing icon sizes to 32px and using consistent 6px padding, we'll create a more flexible and accurate representation of the asset list.

The primary goal is to eliminate rigid height constraints and extra margins that disrupt the intended design flow. This means carefully removing `marginVertical`, adjusting icon sizes, and trusting the row layout's padding to manage spacing effectively.</details></think>

---

Based on my analysis of the official Ledger Live Mobile code, I've identified the spacing issues. The problem is that you have multiple components applying different spacing patterns, creating excessive space between assets. Let me fix this by applying the exact spacing standards used in Ledger Live Mobile.

## **Spacing Analysis Summary:**

**Official Ledger Live Mobile Standards:**
- **Vertical Padding**: `pt={6} pb={6}` (24px each = 48px total)
- **Icon Size**: 32px 
- **Icon Spacing**: `ml={4}` (16px)
- **No fixed heights** - content determines size
- **No extra margins** - only row padding

**Current Issues:**
1. **AssetsListView**: Adding extra `marginVertical: 12` (24px per item)
2. **AssetsList**: Using wrong padding `py={3}` instead of letting AssetRowLayout handle it
3. **Mixed icon sizes**: 40px vs official 32px
4. **Fixed heights** conflicting with proper padding

Let me implement the fixes:

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to fix the main issue - the extra marginVertical that's being applied in AssetsListView. This is adding 24px extra spacing per item.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to fix the AssetRowLayout to use the correct icon size (32px instead of 40px) and remove the conflicting minHeight.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to fix the AssetsList.tsx component to remove the conflicting spacing since it's not using AssetRowLayout properly. The issue is that this component is applying its own padding and height instead of using the AssetRowLayout component.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I also need to fix the icon spacing in AssetsList - it should be `ml={4}` (after the icon) not `mr={4}` (before the text content). Let me check the structure and fix it.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to check if there are any other spacing issues. Let me also update the linking line positioning in AssetRowLayout since the icon size changed from 40px to 32px. The marginLeft should be calculated to center the line with the icon.

For a 32px icon, the line should be at: 32px / 2 = 16px from left edge, so marginLeft should be "16px" instead of "21px".</details></think>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I need to also fix the bottom link line positioning.</details></think>

Let me check if there are any other asset-related components that might have spacing issues:

---

Read file: UIReplicationLedger/src/components/SimpleAssetRow.tsx

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The SimpleAssetRow also has spacing issues:
- Uses fixed `height: 72` 
- Uses `paddingVertical: 16` (32px total) instead of official 48px
- Uses icon size 40px instead of 32px
- Uses `paddingHorizontal: 24` which should be handled by the container

Let me fix this component as well:</details></think>
